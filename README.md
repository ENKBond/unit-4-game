# unit-4-game
How the game works:
A random number between 19 and 120 is automatically generated when the page loads. 
Four gems are visible on the page for users to click on.
When each gem is clicked, a random number between 1 and 12 is generated and assigned to that gem. The value of the gem is added to the user's total score. The user continues to click gems to gain points.
If the user's total score is equal to the random generated number, an alert that they have won is displayed and the win count increases by one.
If the user's total score is greater than the random generated number, an alert that they have lost is displayed and the loss count increases by one.
The game automatically resets and a new random number between 19 and 120 is generated, allowing the user to play again.
